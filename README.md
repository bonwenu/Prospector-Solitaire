# Prospector-Solitaire

This is a game I learn to build through Jeremy Gibson's <i>Game Design, Prototyping, and Development</i>. Prospector Solitaire is a game of solitaire that monitors your score. The goal is to get a lower score. The more cards you have to draw from the deck, the higher the score goes.
